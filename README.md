# VoxelMaterials

VoxelMaterials allows you to create the metal, emissive and roughness texture map.

VoxelMaterials is a program that I created, initially just for me, to easily generate texture maps for use in game engines without having to create them with blender. It is aimed at people like me who have no experience with programs like blender and just want to be able to add texture maps to their voxel models.

**This program is made with godot version 3.4.4**
